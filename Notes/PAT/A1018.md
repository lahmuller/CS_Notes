# Public Bike Management
## key point
* Understand the requirments.
  * Find the shortest path from PBMC(Public Bike Management Center) to the given station.
  * If the shortest path is not unique, choose the one with minimum number of bikes we need to take from the PBMC.
  * If the answer is still not unique, choose the one with minimum number of bikes we need to take back the PBMC. The judge's data guarantee that such a path is unique, let's call it answer path. 
  * How many bikes should we take from PBMC?
    * we need to take the bikes that just right to make every station on the path perfect(i.e., half of its maximum capacity) first time you get there(i.e., we can't use the extra bikes we get from late stations to make up previous stations).
  * How many bikes we take back?
    * With the ***n*** bikes you take from PBMC at begining, we are supposed to make every station on the path perfect, which is add to or minus from ***n***. And after making last station perfect, we take ***n*** bikes back.
* My thought is quite similar to the solution of [A1003](A1003.md), find the path from PBMC to destination and compare it to previous answer path according to the rules elaborated above.
* Storing the deviation from the perfect number of each station rather than the number of bikes helps the conciseness.
